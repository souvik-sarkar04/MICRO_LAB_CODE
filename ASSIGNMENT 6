QUESTION 1 : PRIME
START:
LXI H, 204EH      ; Point HL to memory location F100H (where number is stored)

MOV A, M          ; Load the number into accumulator
MVI C, 00H        ; Clear register C (to count total factors)
MOV D, A          ; Copy number to D
MOV E, A          ; Copy number to E (for later restoration)

L2: 
MOV B, D          ; Load B with D (current divisor)

L1: 
CMP B             ; Compare A (current dividend) with B (divisor)
JC LABEL          ; If A < B, jump to LABEL (cannot divide further)

SUB B             ; Subtract divisor B from dividend A
JNZ L1            ; If result is not zero, continue dividing

LABEL:
CPI 00H           ; Check if result is exactly zero
JNZ SKIP          ; If not zero, skip incrementing C

INR C             ; Increment factor counter (C)

SKIP:
MOV A, E          ; Restore original number into A
DCR D             ; Decrement D (next divisor)
JNZ L2            ; If D â‰  0, continue checking next divisor

MOV A, C          ; After loop, load C (number of factors) into A
CPI 02H
JNZ NON_PRIME
MVI A, 01H
STA 204FH
HLT

NON_PRIME:
MVI A,02H
STA 204FH         ; Store result into F101H

HLT               ; Halt the program


QUESTION 2 : LINEAR SEARCH
LXI H, 204EH ; store element to be searched in B
MOV B,M
INX H
MOV C,M ; store number of elements in array in C
SKIP: INX H ; point to next element of array
MOV A,M
CMP B ; if A == B(value) -> value found -> go to LOOP(true case)
JZ LOOP
DCR C ; decrease counter
JNZ SKIP
MVI A, 02H ; loop has ended and control did not transfer to LOOP(true case) -> that means false case(element not found) -> store 02H at 2060H to signify the element has not been found
STA 2060H
HLT
LOOP: ; (true case) -> store 01H at 2060H to signify the element has been found
MVI A, 01H
STA 2060H
HLT
