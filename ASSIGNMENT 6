    QUESTION 2
LXI H, 204EH ; store element to be searched in B
MOV B,M
INX H
MOV C,M ; store number of elements in array in C
SKIP: INX H ; point to next element of array
MOV A,M
CMP B ; if A == B(value) -> value found -> go to LOOP(true case)
JZ LOOP
DCR C ; decrease counter
JNZ SKIP
MVI A, 02H ; loop has ended and control did not transfer to LOOP(true case) -> that means false case(element not found) -> store 02H at 2060H to signify the element has not been found
STA 2060H
HLT
LOOP: ; (true case) -> store 01H at 2060H to signify the element has been found
MVI A, 01H
STA 2060H
HLT
