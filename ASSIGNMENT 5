QUESTION 1 - FIBONACCI
; int a = 0, b = 1;
; for(int i=3; i<=10; i++) {
; int c = a+b;
; a = b;
; b = c;
; }
LXI H, 2050H ; starting address from where the fibonacci series will start
LDA 204FH ; in this location the number of terms of fibonacci series needed will be stored -> store it in D
MOV D,A
MVI B, 00H ; first term(a=0)
MVI C, 01H ; second term(b=1)
MVI A, 00H ; third term(c=0)
LOOP: MOV M,A ; store the current term of the series in memory
ADD C ; (c = a + b)
MOV B,C ; (a = b)
MOV C,A ; (b = c)
MOV A,B ; (c = a) ; extra step to extract the next term of the series in A
INX H ; move to next memory location
