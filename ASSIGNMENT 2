; Addition of 2 16-bit numbers(with carry)(without using memory pointer and only 16 bit operations) : 
LXI H, 2050H     ; HL points to the LSB of first 16-bit number (8000H and 8001H)
LXI D, 2052H     ; DE points to the LSB of second 16-bit number (8002H and 8003H)

; Add lower bytes
LDAX D           ; Load (DE) content into Accumulator
ADD M            ; Add (HL) content to Accumulator
MOV C, A         ; Store result LSB into register C

; Increment HL and DE to point to higher bytes
INX H
INX D

; Add higher bytes
LDAX D           ; Load (DE) content into Accumulator
ADC M            ; Add (HL) content + previous carry to Accumulator
MOV B, A         ; Store result MSB into register B

; Move the result into HL pair to store
MOV H, B
MOV L, C

; Store result 16-bit at 8050H
SHLD 2054H       ; Store L (lower byte) at 8050H and H (higher byte) at 8051H

; Check for final carry after addition
JNC DONE         ; If no carry, jump to DONE

; If carry generated, store 01H at 8052H
MVI A, 01H       
STA 2056H

DONE:
HLT              ; Halt the program
